# Practical Python

## General guide

This small collection of source files is organized around operations
that I have tended need in my code, regardless of the programming language
that I have been using at the time. Because I have been using Python for
the past seven years, it seems logical to code them (again) in Python.

### `beachhead`

This is the only file not mentioned in the init.
